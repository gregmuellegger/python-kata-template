# pyproject.toml

The idea is to learn how to properly setup a project using pyproject.toml and
all the associated tools.

Common things to do with a `pyproject.toml` are:
- Giving a package name
- Specifying dependencies (and ranges of compatible version)
- Specifying dev dependencies (like testing utilities)
- Specifying compatible python versions
- Pinning exact versions for recreating environments

Questions to consider:
- How to initially create the setup?
- How to reproduce the environment created?
